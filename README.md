## Overview

Healthy business competition is essential for customer benefit and market vitality. This competition involves not just the number of companies, but also how well competition is maintained and market share distribution. In a scenario with two competing companies, Goliath and David dynamics can significantly affect market outcomes. In our case, CMT (Creative Mobile Technologies) is facing stiff competition from Verifone.

## Business Problem

CMT has a significantly lower total fare amount compared to Verifone. Additionally, the service proportion between the two vendors highlights a similar discrepancy.

## Analysis and Findings

1. **Competitors**:
   - **CMT (Creative Mobile Technologies)**
   - **Verifone**

2. **Service Distance Range**:
   - CMT has a smaller service distance range compared to Verifone.
   - The proportion of CMT's services decreases as the distance increases.

3. **Fare Rate**:
   - The average fare rate for CMT is lower than that of Verifone.
   - This suggests that CMT's lower performance is not due to higher prices.

4. **Temporal Analysis**:
   - Analysis over different days confirms the problem but does not provide new insights or confirm any hypotheses.

5. **Geographical Analysis**:
   - In every area, CMT has a lower service quantity proportion compared to Verifone.
   - Notably, in Queens borough, CMT's service proportion is alarmingly low at only 5%.

## Recommendations

To improve its market position, CMT should consider the following strategies:

1. **Expand Service Range**:
   - Extend the service range to cover longer distances.
   - Focus on capturing market share in higher distance segments, as these generate higher fare amounts.

2. **Increase Fleet Presence**:
   - Increase the number of available fleets in every area.
   - Specifically, target Queens borough for expansion, where there is a significant market potential but currently low CMT presence.

## Conclusion

CMT's competitive position can be improved by addressing the service distance limitations and increasing fleet presence in underserved areas. By focusing on these areas, CMT can capture a larger market share and increase total fare amounts.
